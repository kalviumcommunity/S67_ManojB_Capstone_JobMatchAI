# Title: JobMatch AI

## Idea Brief

Project JobMatch AI is a web-based AI powered resume analyzer that helps job seekers optimize their resume by comparing them to job descriptions and providing AI-based suggestions. This web-application enhances resume by analyzing keywords, structure and missing skills to increase the chances of landing an interview.

This can be implemented with the help of AI. We take information from clients like their resume(PDF/DOCX) and job description to compare with the resume. We use NPL (Natural Language Processing) based evaluation of skills, keywords, formatting, and missing sections. Presenting AI-generated rating based on job match percentage and recommending for better wording, additional skills, or formatting.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js 
- Backend: FastAPI or Django (Python)
- AI Processing: Gemini AI API or spaCy for NLP-based analysis
- Database: MongoDB (for storing user resumes and reports)
- Storage: Firebase for uploaded files
